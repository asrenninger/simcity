This analysis has shown several linkages between American cities. Just as assessing urban form and how it relates to lived experience is subjective, so too would be any assessment of these similarities and clusters. Yet we find evidence that the similarity score captures some relevant aspects of this feel with in both how much it agrees with cluster analysis and in how cities in distinct classes and geographies are labeled similar by this algorithm. Generally big, gridded cities are more related than small, messy ones; regions also show similarity. New York is similar to Chicago and Philadelphia—other big, gridded cities—and when we construct a network of relationships from similarity scores, the center is occupied by Orlando, Tampa, and Jacksonville—all Florida cities. The fact that this score is able to hint at an area typology—and within that, the first law of geography—is reassuring. Below we plot samples of cities ranked 1 through 4 in our sample alongside comparison cities, with cities ranked 96 through 100 in our sample following.

Within the sample of less populous downtowns, some geographic consistencies stand out. Tacoma and Seattle are related (West), as are Boise and Denver (Mountain West); Garland and Plano—a few miles apart—are both similar to Baton Rouge, which is in turn not far from them. We see this in clustering analysis as well: geography is an important predictor of how similar any given downtown will be to another.
