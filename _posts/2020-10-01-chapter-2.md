In this section we take the variables discussed 

1. [clusters](#clusters)
2. [similarity score](#similarity-score)
3. [comparison](#comparison)

## clusters

To select the number of clusters, we use a visual technique that takes the quality of the model on the vertical axis and the number of clusters on the horizontal axis and forces the analyst to determine where the returns to clusters cease to grow. The result is the below plot which shows a steady reduction in error that starts to bend between 5 and 6 clusters. There is not a clear elbow, but the curve is less steep from 6 to 7 clusters as from 5 to 6. We move forward under the assumption that 6 clusters is deal for this analysis: too many and it will be difficult to build a theory of each category; too few and the categories will lack meaning.
