### building a similarity score for cities

This project uses nearest neighbor and cluster analysis to find out which cities in America are morphologically similar. It gathers a sample of "Downtown America" by extracting tiles from OpenStreetMap and then quantitifies several aspects of these data before grouping these urban cores—304 in total—by similarity. The results and analysis are hosted [here](https://asrenninger.github.io/simcity/).
